Supermarket checkout activities automation 

In this repository, there is the source code of the exercises I was required to implement in the module "Java I". There are both some numerical exercises in order to acquire some first experience and then the main exercise.
The main exercise is about automating the checkout on supermarkets by printing the customer's receipts relatively to the products that they have purchased.
